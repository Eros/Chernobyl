# Chernobyl
A basic testing ground for any code that I need to keep handy. I also named it chernobyl cause it'll probably blow up.

# Important

Not all of the code in here is mine, a lot of it was used in the Highlander project. The code that is not mine is registered to the original author in their readme files, I do not take credibility for their code.

In addition this code is very old and mostly doesn't work anymore apart from a couple, feel free to take it, adjust it, do what the hell you like with it, I'm not held responsible for what you do with it and how you use it.
